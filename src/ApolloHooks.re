        me { id, name }
      }
    |}];

  Why we return a tuple? While designing and using the API we came to the conclusion that would be much more convient to have a value that would attend
  the majority of simple usages and a full for when you need to do a complex UI, such as infinite scroll.

  The value [simple] ({!type:Query.variant('a)}) helps you to consume your data with simplicity, type safety and exhaustiveness check.
  But for those cases where you really want do do a fine-grained control of your data flow – such as when you have [loading] and [data] at the same time –
  that's when [full] ({!type:Query.queryResult('a)}) becomes more useful.

  {[
    module Query = [%graphql {|
      query MyQuery {
        me { id, name }
      }
    |}];

    [@react.component]
    let make = () => {
      let (_simple, full) = useQuery(Query.definitions);

      /* `full` is a record type so you pattern against it's possible combos of values */
      switch(full) {
        /* Initial loading */
        | { loading: true, data: None } => React.string("loading...")
        /* Error but no data */
        | { loading: false, data: None, error: Some(error) } => React.string("Something went wrong")
        /* When we have some data and we tried to refetch but got an error */
        | { loading: false, data: Some(data), error: Some(error)  } =>
          <>
            {React.string("Something went wrong")}
            <RenderData data onLoadMore={full.refetch} />
          </>
        /* Just data */
        | { loading: false, data: Some(data), error: None } =>
          <>
            {React.string("Something went wrong")}
            <RenderData data onLoadMore={full.refetch} />
          </>
        | Data(data) =>
          React.string("Hello, " ++ data##me##name)
        /* Not loading? No data? No error? That's weird */
        | {loading: false, data: None, error: null} =>
          React.string("Woa something went really wrong! But the programmer remembered to handle this case! Report to us")
      }
    }

  Quite more complex right? Gladly it's not always that we have that level of complexity.

  That covers the most common cases of usage. If you want to see more complex usages check out the examples folder.
